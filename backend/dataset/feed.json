The practice run for this, Apollo 10, launched in May 1969, and aimed to carry out all the stages of the Apollo 11 mission except the lunar landing.  Apollo 10 still holds the record for the fastest human beings have ever flown; along with the distance record for the farthest mankind has ever been from the Earth.\r\n\r\nOnce it had completed its historic mission, the Lunar Module ascent stage, known as \u201cSnoopy\u201d (named after the famous \u201cPeanuts\u201d cartoon character), was sent off in an orbit around the Sun - and 42 years later, it\u2019s still out there somewhere, travelling through space.\r\n\r\nNow, the Faulkes Telescope team at the University of Glamorgan will be working with UK amateur astronomer Nick Howes, along with Ernesto Guido and Giovanni Sostero of the Remanzacco Observatory in Italy, to attempt what could be an\r\nalmost impossible task - finding Snoopy. And this time, they are inviting schools to help with the search.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe whole history of Apollo is remarkable and include some of the most inspiring scientific and explorative missions in history\u201d said Howes. \u201cAfter the success of our recent asteroid detection project, where we regularly discovered extremely faint, fast-moving objects, we were considering what we could do next\u201d he continued.\r\n\r\nThis new and exciting challenge was just what Howes, a long time fan of the Apollo missions, was looking for.  \u201cAfter the fantastic coverage work experience student Hannah Blyth gained in helping us find over 25 new asteroids we thought this would be an exciting way to engage schools again\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nWith several other Apollo stages still out there, the team will not only be trying to locate Snoopy, but will be working with various experts in attempts to recover these too.\r\n\r\nComprehensive surveys looking for Near Earth Object (asteroids that come within about 3 million miles of Earth) have previously failed to find Snoopy, but the team are encouraged by their success in finding so many small, faint asteroids recently. But the team is under no illusions about the daunting complexity of this challenge.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo say it\u2019s like finding a needle in a haystack is doing a disservice to the haystack. Whilst there are records of the last known movements and orbital information for Snoopy, this is going back over 40 years. The module has been affected by the gravity of the Sun, Earth and Moon for all that time, and all sorts of other factors mean we need to search a very big chunk of sky for this thing\u201d said Dr. Paul Roche, head of astronomy at Glamorgan University, \u201cBut, to paraphrase President Kennedy, we are trying these things \u2018not because they are easy but because they are hard\u2019 \u2013 this will be a real test for the hardware and the students involved\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe project, which is enlisting help from multiple UK schools, will attempt to post regular coordinate data which the teams will then examine on a daily basis. \u201cThere will be a huge search field to examine, so this is not something which will happen overnight. It could take weeks, months, years - or we may possibly never find it. But we\u2019re going to try, and as a bonus, the areas we\u2019ll be searching will hopefully throw up new asteroids, so there will be useful results whether we find Snoopy or not\u201d commented Dr. Sarah Roberts, Education Director of the Faulkes Telescope Project at Glamorgan.\r\n\r\n\u201cGetting students involved in analyzing real scientific data, and looking for moving objects in a field full of stars is good science\u201d continues Dr Roche \u201cand whilst many students start off using the Faulkes Telescopes to image \u201cpretty\u201d things like nebulas or galaxies, we are always trying to move them on to do more exciting projects, and this one will hopefully do that\u201d.\r\n\r\nAfter looking at records in the NASA archives which give the last known speed and direction of the module, the team know it will be moving very quickly, so even if they do find it, initially it will just be a moving blur on the sky. But they are encouraged by the re-discovery of the Apollo 12 third stage rocket, which was imaged in 2002.\r\n\r\nThe team are working with Mike Loucks of US-based \u201cSpace Exploration Engineering\u201d. Mike worked to reconstruct the Apollo 13 trajectory in 2000 and specializes in cis-lunar mission analysis and design. Mike said, \u201cWhen I first heard about this project I was very intrigued. I did similar work in 2003 to investigate the trajectory of an Apollo 12 Saturn V rocket stage.  Using the techniques from both of those cases, along with some advanced trajectory tools we use to fly real lunar missions; hopefully we can narrow down the search areas to something manageable and give the team a fighting chance of finding Snoopy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhilst there is every chance we won\u2019t find it, it\u2019s like the lottery - unless you play, you don\u2019t win\u201d says Howes - and with odds not far short of the lottery, this is a truly ambitious project. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at this like SETI@Home, the search for radio signals from ET\u201d, continued Howes, \u201cThe chances of finding anything in that are tiny, but millions of people tried. With our Snoopy project, we hope to involve hundreds of schools users, with the bonus of finding dozens of new asteroids and maybe some comets in our search areas means we\u2019ll be doing great science at the same time\u201d.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that schools will also be excited about the chances of seeing this, and possibly other relics of the Apollo era \u2013and, in the case of \u201cSnoopy\u201d, be the first humans to see it since astronauts Cernan, Stafford and Young left her adrift in 1969.

A DOT is a practice of sustainability where your personal passions and your daily routine unite.  It's as simple as making yourself and the people around you committed to developing daily habits that will impact the world in a sustainable way. It\u2019s about the collective impact of billions of small actions. It's about big thinking and small changes. It's about opportunity instead of obligation. \n\nDOT is a project of the Syracuse University Students in Free Enterprise (SU SIFE) team in partnership with Saatchi & Saatchi S. DOT was originally started as True Blue, an initiative developed by Saatchi as an engagement tool for employees at Walmart. It was then adapted for college campuses by the Net Impact team at William & Mary College. \n\nThe SU SIFE team has been working since early November 2010 to begin implementing DOT on the Syracuse University campus. The goal of SU SIFE was to create a model that could be used to implement DOT on a campus with a large student population (20,000 students at Syracuse University). A major part of this implementation included the design and development of an online platform, DOTonCampus.com, where students can easily submit their individual DOTs. This online platform is easily and readily scalable to other universities, regardless of the size of their student population, and provides a simple way to measure the total commitments of students on any given campus. To date, students, faculty and staff members at Syracuse University have pledged over 900 DOTs.\n\nDOT is expanding quickly across the country, and actively seeking out more student groups interested in implementing the DOT program on their campus. Currently, The George Washington University is the only other school tying into the online platform, but talks are ongoing with several other schools including: Washington University in St. Louis, Penn State University, New York University, University of Arizona, and Louisiana State University.

The businesses span across many different industries, and include a restaurant, an office furniture supplier, an interior design firm and a credit union. Our team works hand-in-hand with the owners and managers of these businesses to implement environmentally friendly practices, with the ultimate goal of graduating from the program and achieving a \u201cgreen business certification.\u201d\n\nOver the course of the semester, student-teams for each business utilized a comprehensive matrix of different green initiatives, covering over 300 items on topics such as waste-reduction, environmentally responsible purchasing and energy efficient practices. The teams visited the businesses weekly to track their progress and consult with the businesses to help them see the results of these practices positively impacting not only the environment, but their bottom line as well. \n\nIn order to help impact the environment without negatively affecting their bottom line, one of our student-teams was able to secure a $1,000 grant for their business to help execute many of the initiatives covered in the matrix. One specific result of these environmentally friendly practices was the reduction of heating costs, saving one business over $300 annually.
